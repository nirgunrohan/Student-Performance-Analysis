📊 Student Performance Analysis

A data analysis and visualization project focused on understanding the key factors affecting student academic performance using statistical analysis and interactive dashboards.

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes student performance data to identify relationships between demographic, social, academic, and behavioral factors and their impact on students’ final grades (G3).
The analysis combines data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical insights, and dashboard visualization to draw meaningful conclusions.

The dataset contains records of students from two schools and includes 33 features related to personal background, family conditions, study habits, and academic results.

🎯 Aim of the Project

To analyze student performance data

To study the relationship between various features and students’ grades

To identify key factors influencing final academic performance

To visualize insights using interactive dashboards

📈 Key Insights

Gender has no significant impact on average grades

Age shows a slight decline in grades initially, with improvement in later years

Parental cohabitation status does not affect student performance

Students with:

Fewer past failures

Better family relationships

Educational support
tend to perform better academically

Internet access and study-related support show positive trends

📊 Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard provides insights on:

Average grades by age, failures, family size, and parental education

Relationship between absences and final grades

Impact of internet access, family support, and paid classes

School-wise and reason-wise performance comparison
