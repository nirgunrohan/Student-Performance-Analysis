📊 Student Performance Analysis

A data analysis and visualization project focused on understanding the key factors affecting student academic performance using statistical analysis and interactive dashboards.

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes student performance data to identify relationships between demographic, social, academic, and behavioral factors and their impact on students’ final grades (G3).
The analysis combines data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical insights, and dashboard visualization to draw meaningful conclusions.
The dataset contains records of students from two schools and includes 33 features related to personal background, family conditions, study habits, and academic results.

🎯 Aim of the Project

1. To analyze student performance data
2. To study the relationship between various features and students’ grades
3. To identify key factors influencing final academic performance
4. To visualize insights using interactive dashboards

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes attributes such as:

1. Demographic: age, sex, address
2. Family background: parental education, family size, cohabitation status
3. Academic support: family support, paid classes, internet access
4. Lifestyle factors: free time, going out, alcohol consumption, health
5. Academic performance:
    G1 – First period grade
    G2 – Second period grade
    G3 – Final grade (target variable)

📌 Course analyzed: Portuguese Language

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

1. Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
2. Power BI (for dashboard visualization)
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Git & GitHub

🔍 Methodology

1. Data Acquisition: Loaded and inspected the dataset
2. Data Understanding: Checked shape, columns, unique values, and statistics
3. Data Cleaning: Verified missing values and handled outliers
4. Exploratory Data Analysis: Correlation analysis, Distribution and trend analysis
5. Data Visualization: Bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, Interactive Power BI dashboard
6. Insight Generation: Feature-wise impact on final grades

📈 Key Insights

1. Gender has no significant impact on average grades
2. Age shows a slight decline in grades initially, with improvement in later years
3. Parental cohabitation status does not affect student performance
4. Students with: Fewer past failures, Better family relationships, Educational support tend to perform better academically
5. Internet access and study-related support show positive trends

📊 Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard provides insights on:
1. Average grades by age, failures, family size, and parental education
2.Relationship between absences and final grades
3. Impact of internet access, family support, and paid classes
4. School-wise and reason-wise performance comparison
